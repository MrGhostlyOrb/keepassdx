## What is KeePassDX?

An alternative to remembering an endless list of passwords manually. This is made more difficult by **using different passwords for each account**.

KeePassDX is a **password manager**, which helps you **manage your passwords**. You can put all your passwords in one database, locked with a **master key** and/or a **keyfile**. You **only have to remember one master password or select the keyfile** to unlock the database.

## Small print?

KeePassDX is under **open source GPL3 license**, meaning you can use, study, change and share it at will. Copyleft ensures it stays that way.
From the full source, anyone can build, fork, and check whether for example the encryption algorithms are implemented correctly.
There is **no advertising**.

Do not worry, **the main features remain completely free**.
